lip.mp4
--------
Cubic surface parametrized by (s,t,s^2+s^2*t+t^3) with parabolic curve.
The contour curve is first empty, and becomes a "lip" curve with 2 cusps. 
The lip event happens when the contour is an isolated point.

lipPar.mp4
----------
Parabolic surface of the example surface in lip.mp4.
The parabolic surface is ruled by the unique principal tangents at the parabolic points of the given surface.

beak2beak.mp4
-------------
Cubic surface parametrized by (s,t,s^2-s^2*t+t^3) with parabolic curve.
Two cusps come together and form a tacnode, which then breaks into 2 smooth branches. 
The beak-to-beak event happens exactly at the tacnode.

beak2beakPar.mp4
----------------
Parabolic surface of the example surface in beak2beak.mp4.
The parabolic surface is ruled by the unique principal tangents at the parabolic points of the given surface.

swallowtail.mp4
---------------
Quartic surface parametrized by (s,t,s^2+3*s*t+t^4) with flecnodal curve and 2 flecnodal lines at a point.
The contour is first smooth, and becomes a "swallowtail" curve with 2 cusps and a node. 
The swallowtail event happens when the 2 cusps and the node come together to a higher order singularity.

swallowtailFlec.mp4
-------------------
Flecnodal surface of the example surface in swallowtail.mp4.
The flecnodal surface is ruled by the flecnodal lines of the given surface.

To look at the interactive visualizations instead of the videos, follow these steps:
1) Download the whole folder "chapter6".
2) Run "sage -n jupyter" in a console from that directory. This opens a new opened browser window.
3) Open "Examples.ipynb" in the newly opened browser window.
4) Run the code (by clicking into it and then pressing SHIFT+ENTER).
5) Now you should see plots that you can move with your mouse.

lip.mp4
--------
Cubic surface parametrized by (s,t,s^2+s^2*t+t^3) with parabolic curve.
The contour curve is first empty, and becomes a "lip" curve with 2 cusps. 
The lip event happens when the contour is an isolated point.

lipPar.mp4
----------
Parabolic surface of the example surface in lip.mp4.
The parabolic surface is ruled by the unique principal tangents at the parabolic points of the given surface.

beak2beak.mp4
-------------
Cubic surface parametrized by (s,t,s^2-s^2*t+t^3) with parabolic curve.
Two cusps come together and form a tacnode, which then breaks into 2 smooth branches. 
The beak-to-beak event happens exactly at the tacnode.

beak2beakPar.mp4
----------------
Parabolic surface of the example surface in beak2beak.mp4.
The parabolic surface is ruled by the unique principal tangents at the parabolic points of the given surface.

swallowtail.mp4
---------------
Quartic surface parametrized by (s,t,s^2+3*s*t+t^4) with flecnodal curve and 2 flecnodal lines at a point.
The contour is first smooth, and becomes a "swallowtail" curve with 2 cusps and a node. 
The swallowtail event happens when the 2 cusps and the node come together to a higher order singularity.

swallowtailFlec.mp4
-------------------
Flecnodal surface of the example surface in swallowtail.mp4.
The flecnodal surface is ruled by the flecnodal lines of the given surface.
